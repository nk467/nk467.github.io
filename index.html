    <h1>Hi, I'm Kate.</h1>

    <div class="bio">
      <p>
      I am a third-year Information Science major at Cornell University. Some of my interests include ethics in technology, UI/UX design, and the role technology plays in shaping our society and culture.
      </p>

      <p>
      After graduation, I hope to do meaningful work that has a positive impact and improve people's lives.
      </p>

      <p>
      On campus, I'm involved in <a href="https://cusd.cornell.edu/">Cornell University Sustainable Design</a>. My subteam, Sustainable Mobility, is currently working directly with the City of Ithaca on projects including the redesign of signange in the downtown garage on Seneca Street. I am also on the layout team of the Cornell Daily Sun, which designs the print issues of the newspaper.
      </p>

      <p>
      In my free time, I like to read books and write blogs for my Medium page.
