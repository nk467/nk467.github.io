    <h2 id="garage_heading">Seneca Garage Project</h2>
    <p>In Spring 2019, CUSD Sustainable Mobility began a project aimed at applying systems engineering and design thinking to improve the Seneca Garage signage and user systems.</p>

    <div class="project-statement">
        <h3>Project Statement</h3>
        <p>Design a wayfinding system for the Senaca Garage in Downtown Ithaca that uses intuitive navigation, clear and informative signage, seamless payment and exiting, to inspire people to explore Ithaca</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The redesign of Seneca Garage is just one element of a larger system that encourages the users to explore and connect with the city of Ithaca.</p>

    <p>The team is focused on improving the overall look and feel of the garage by incorporating elements of local nature and Ithaca itself into an otherwise purely functional space. We hope to build a portal to downtown Ithaca by creating a comfortable, safe, and efficient user experience that fosters an eagerness to further explore the city.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>The existing signange is cluttered, visually inconsistent, and difficult to read. Signs and instructions were piled on each other with no cohesive system in place.</p>

    <h3>Design Proposal</h3>

    <h4 class="subheading">Parking Flow and Improved Usability</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear and concise parking instructions and rules</li>
        <li>Cohesive look-and-feel for users to easily recognize signage fo different parking purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="subheading">New Navigation Signage</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction of color schemes and animal themes as parking area memory retention technique</li>
        <li>Directories with embedded parking instructions and designated parking spaces</li>
        <li>Increased user engagement with fun facts and animal cutouts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Testing</h3>
    <p>During the design process, the team considered various user types to ensure the system meets the specific needs of all users. Interviews with individuals of each type confirmed that implementation will be a positive asset to the downtown Ithaca community.</p>

    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementation of wayfinding system in progress</li>
        <li>Regular follow-up meetings with garage contractors</li>
    </ul>
