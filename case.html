    <h2 id="case_heading">Case Study</h2>
    <p>This summer, I was invited to build an app prototpye for social good at <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/csnyc">Apple's Creative Studios</a> in New York City.</p>

    <h3>The Inspiration</h3>
    <p>In 2012, my family immigrated to the US from South Korea, being the first in our extended family to do so.
      While my sister and I quickly acclimated to life in America, the transition was more challenging for my mom
      who struggled to learn English.
    </p>

    <p>Over the past decade, my mom has found a vibrant Korean community in northern New Jersey and along with it, 
      a network of Korean doctors, lawyers, and real estate agents whom she can speak to directly.</p>

    <h3>Why this matters</h3>
    <p>
      More than 1 million immigrants arrive in the US every year. Additionally, of the 37 million adults in the US
      who speak a language other than English, 48 percent reported that they have limited proficiency in English.
    </p>

        "... several studies have shown that patients who face language barriers have poorer health outcomes compared 
        with patients who speak the local language."

    </div>

    <p>
      Among those who needed an interpreter during a helath care visit, less than half (48 percent) report that 
      they always or usually had one. Even in the absence of language barriers, racial disparaties were observed 
      in quality of patient-physician interactions, which is lower for non-White patients, particularly Latinos 
      and Asian Ameircans.

        "Compared to other minority groups, Asian Americans are least likely to feel that their doctor understood 
        their background and values and are most likely to report that their doctor looked down on them."
